### 2024-01-06 - Brief description
10min - Spent time figuring out the project and dividing up tasks.

### 2024-01-07
10min - organized files
20min - worked on errno and creating relevant files
30min - worked on parse_args

### 2026-01-08
30min - worked on makelist and combining it with parse_args
30min - currently working on reading & writing from a CSV file in continuation of makelist. Currently incomplete w some errors

### 2026-01-12
40min - decided that a 2D array won't work very well, began switching to a 3D array
30min - fixed reading and writing words from the csv into the array, completely working
20min - currently working on subsequent functions, such as randomizing words removing a word from the list ; didn't do removing word, not needed for now
60min - made all the logic stuff, like checking if word is valid/correct. the game fully works!!

### 2026-01-13
20min - not working properly on lab computer, fixed errors
20min - spent time figuring out next functions to implement and divided work. Began adding forking and unnamed pipes,  where child reads stdin and prompts parent for response/checking word.

### 2026-01-14
40min - got forking and pipes to do basic stuff, like parent prompting user and child, reading their responses, and then replying. Its going to be child versus user, where the parent acts like the server instead.

### 2026-01-15
30min - realized that its too late to add forking and completely breaks program so decided to remove (also no guarantee it will work on lab computers since its kind of last second)
10min - reorganizing things
